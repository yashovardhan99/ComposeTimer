# Compose Timer

![Workflow result](https://github.com/yashovardhan99/ComposeTimer/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

This app is a submission for the [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge)
Week 2

## :scroll: Description

Compose Timer is a simple and easy to use Timer with extensive animations.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

I wanted to try out some complex animations as part of Compose. I have been able to achieve quite a
bit of success in that regard with this app.

I also managed to successfully manage state in the app with the animations resuming when the app is
brought back from the background.

Do try out the app to watch the animations in action!
